# PNW_CAR

This repository contains the R code used to analyze patterns and predictors of carbon accumulation rates (CAR) across various wetland and land-use types in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) United States. These analyses are associated with a manuscript in preparation: "Soil accretion and carbon accumulation rates across reference, restored, and disturbed tidal wetlands in the Pacific Northwest, USA". Poppe KL, Rybczyk JM, Janousek CN, Bridgham SD, Cornu C, Williams T, Diefenderfer HL, Borde AB, Perillat H, Brophy LS, Apple J, and Knox SH.
